# ABSTRACT

Highly increasing rush of traffic and increasing frequency of road accidents appeals automated vehicle monitoring system in which record of vehicles is maintained in the database and routinely overlooked by traffic admins. The proposed research is based on Automatic Number Plate Recognition using Neural networks. The Process is in 3 steps, first one is comprised on Image Processing which is Enhancement of image contrast, Morphological operations, and Segmentation of labels; second is comprised of Pattern Recognition, for this purpose a Feedforward Back Prop. trained Neural Network is used and the last one is verification from Database. For all pre-process, MATLAB is used and proposed Algorithm gives maximum recognition rate. Some Punjab Number plates images are taken for this purpose.

# RESEARCH GAPS OF EXISTING METHODS

Our project improves security in apartment parking lots using smart technology. Unlike other systems, ours is great at recognizing cars even in tricky situations, like when it is moving or there are lots of different types of vehicles around.


# PROPOSED MOTHODOLOGY

# IMAGE ACQUISITION: 
Image acquisition is the process of converting an analogue unaged into digital form. This usually happens in a camera or scanner, but it can be done with any device that produces analogue images, Image acquisition is often used to create a digital representation of data from surveys and experiments, but it can be also used for other purposes such as printing pictures or other types of graphics.
# IMAGE PREPROCESSING: 
Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it. The image processing system usually treats all images as 2D signals when applying cream predetermined signal processing methods.
# NUMBER PLATE EXTRACTION: 
We can extract a number plate can be extracted by using image segmentation method. A. Edge Detection Edge detection is main method of feature detection or number plate detection. In common cases the result of applying thus algorithm is an object boundary with connected curves.
# CHARACTER RECOGNITION: 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process that converts an image of text into a machine-readable text format. For example, if you scan a form or a receipt, your computer saves the scan as an image file.
# CHARACTER SEGMENTATION: 
The role of segmentation in recognition processing Character segmentation is an operation that seeks to decompose an image of a sequence of characters into sub images of individual symbols. It is one of the decision processes in a system for optical character recognition (OCR).â€ƒ

# OBJECTIVES

This project aims to identify the illegal vehicle by detecting the number plate and by verifying from Paari Vahan application database which is a government application where the status of all the vehicles will be updated and easy to verify.

# OUTCOMES

Introducing an affordable mobile app camera system enhances residential security, streamlines traffic, and facilitates efficient access control. The system's real-time updates on parking, visitor management, and cost-effectiveness contribute to organized and secure community living. As a versatile tool, it also promotes community engagement, leveraging collected data for informed planning while prioritizing resident privacy.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The ANPR system has been tested on various images of vehicles with different sizes and has shown good results in detecting and recognizing number plates. The system's accuracy, processing time, and detection rate can be evaluated by comparing the recognized characters with the ground truth data.
